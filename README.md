slider
======

Allows you to create a responsive animation or slide-show, working dragging a slider when you're at a desktop computer, or swiping with your finger when browsing on a touch device.
How to use it?
At the beginning of the script, you will se two variables: ratio and data:

The var ratio just need you to write the width-height ratio. For instance, I'll have 0.75 if I use 800px x 600px images. But you can use any ratio and change It here.
The data include the images you want to load, in the sample an animation of Fenway Park, but could be anything (the evolution of a particular place using historic photos from Google Earth, a chart changing year by year, or anything you think will fit. As you see, you only need to have the URL of the image (or whatever you want to get inside of it). You can add as many images as you want to, or just two if you prefer to.
